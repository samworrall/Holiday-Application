# Holiday Application 

## Setup

## Running locally
Before you run the application locally, you need to set up your development and test databases. Run:

- $bundle exec rake db:create
- $bundle exec rake db:migrate

Then you can run the specs to make sure everything is working, and then run the server locally:

- $bundle exec rspec
- $bundle exec rails s
